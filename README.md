## 🧭About Me:
I’m a Security Network Operations Center (SNOC) Analyst who helps organizations stay secure, and compliant. Day to day, I investigate suspicious activity, tune defenses, and turn alerts into clear, actionable decisions for my clients.

I work with enterprise firewalls, cloud security tools, and endpoint protection platforms (like Palo Alto, Meraki, SonicWall, Microsoft Sentinel, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, and AWS GuardDuty) to block malicious traffic, analyze phishing emails, and respond to threats before they become serious incidents. I also manage user access, keep Windows systems patched, and help clients plan for things like long-term log storage and network uptime so their business keeps running.

I also leverage AI in my workflow—using prompt engineering and structured questioning to speed up triage, spot patterns in large volumes of data, and generate investigative leads. Just as importantly, I validate AI-assisted findings against logs, telemetry, and evidence so that the final decisions are reliable and defensible.

With 10+ years of customer-facing experience, I’m able to translate complex technical issues into clear language tied to real business needs—so leaders understand the risk and the options. I build KQL runbooks, document repeatable playbooks, and train new analysts so investigations are faster, more consistent, and easier to follow.

I’ve supported environments across financial services, defense industrial base, local government, critical infrastructure (such as water and emergency services), and education-related organizations—always with the same goal: reduce risk, protect people, and communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
